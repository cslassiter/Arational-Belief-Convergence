# Arational-Belief-Convergence
## Overview
This model considers time-to-convergence on a belief in a population as moderated by two parameters: Probability of Belief Change (PBC) and audience size. The population always converges on a single belief, but there are a number of other interesting patterns to the model: agents with very low PBCs usually, but do not always, have their beliefs adopted by the population. And having the highest value for audience size isn't necessarily best. 

Users can find the model, written in Netlogo, as well as R scripts for analyzing data, as well as the data sets I used for analyzing the model.
